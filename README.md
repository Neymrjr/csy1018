After arrangement of diligent work from week 1-12, I was at last ready to make my site. Right off the bat to get some setting about portfolios I googled a portion of the portfolios and increased a few thoughts. At that point from the primary week I have been taking a shot at my pages. I used to spend around 2-3 hours a day. It took me around  70 hours to finish the site. I needed to make my route framework's menu things of same width which I proved unable. Other than that my site is straightforward looking with simple routes and responsive. While finishing my site, I went over various troubles. I went on the web and got some conceivable answers for my issues and our module guide from NAMI Mr. Ganesh Khatri likewise helped me to come over them.
